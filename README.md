# Usefulness of High Level Languages

In this small project, we go through an example to explain **why high level programming languages are useful**.

To go through this example:

1. I have created a very simple python script.
2. Built an executable file (.exe extension) from the python script
3. Tested the python script and the executable
4. Explored the file contents to understand the differences.

## Installation and execution

### Pre-requisites

* Python 3 - here is a link to download the [Python Installer](https://python.org/downloads)
* Git - here is a link to download the [Git Installer](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Execution

```bash
# To download the project code to your computer, type this command in the command line prompt
git clone [address]

# navigate to the project directory
cd usefulness_of_high_level_languages

# Option A: run the python script using the interprer. Remember to also give your name. For example:
python print_name.py Pierre

# Option B: run the executable file. Remember to also give your name. For example:
dist/print_name.exe Pierre

# To show the contents of the python script
cat print_name.py

# To show the contents of teh executable file
# NOTE: There executable contains many commands. So don't be alarmed if you see many things being printed. The printing will stop at some point.
cat dist/print_name.exe 

```
